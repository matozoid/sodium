Sodium - Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) library for multiple languages

----

Fork notes:

This fork uses Maven in a more "normal" way,
takes a layer of dust off the code,
and has a "vavr" branch that uses VAVR types.

----

This is based on Flapjax, Yampa, scala.React and a number of other Functional
Reactive Programming efforts, as well as a lot of personal experience. Enjoy.

Status:
  Java - complete
